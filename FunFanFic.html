    Hermione was tired as she walked home. When she arrived, Ron pulled her inside, and shut the door with a "BANG".
    Without a word, Ron grabbed her hand, and tore off the engagement ring. "FILTHY MUDBLOOD! I DON'T KNOW WHAT I EVER
    SAW IN YOU!!" Hermione was hurt at her husband's words. After all, he had been the one to hex Malfoy in their 2nd
    year for calling her "Mudblood". She slowly walked out the door for the last time, and thought "if only Harry and
    Ginny were here." Her wish came true. Her 2 friends drove up, and took her along with them. She told them what
    happened and Harry Exclaimed,
    "I AM GOING TO <b>KILL</b> YOU, RONALD BILLIUS WEASLEY!"
    Ginny was worried. Her best friend hasn't looked so sad in the entire 19 years that they'd known each other.

    Ron POV

    I haven't felt so lost since the day I was mean to Harry. I had lost my wife for some rumor that she was dating
    Malfoy. She had always given me the best of gifts. For christmas, I gave her a pair of socks. SOCKS! and she always
    thanked me and had given me a gold watch. I never respected her. She always did me. I walked outside, willing her to
    still be there. I needed to apopogize. But it was too late. She was gone, probably to start a better life. I smiled
    through my tears. I did not deserve her. She was a christmas tree topper angel, and I, a worthless piece of coal.
    Goodbye, Hermione. I hope you find the one you deserve and have been looking for.

    Ron...I do not know if you meant what you did, but our time together is over. I need to start my own life, and would
    not, however much I used to love you, BLOOD TRAITOR to ruin it. Goodbye, I hope you will find the one that you
    appreciate and love. I hope you live "happily ever after". I know I will.
