    Yeah, so I know again, that the 'classroom' isn't actually a classroom, but a...lab? In the book it just says
    dungeons, i think...I'm going to re read them again. Anyways, Let's start creating out Hogwarts Castle!!!

 

    <br>
    <br>
    1. Choose what room you are going to make into the potions classroom. I chose the kitchen.
    <br>
    2. start from the top shelves, and work downwards. Get labels and write things like 'draught of living death' and
        'felix felicis'. Hey, did you know that the first words Snape ever said to Harry were an apolgy? Yeah. The
        ingreditnts of draught of living death, if you remember.
    <br>
    3. stick the labels onto the bottles.
    <br>
    4. find some Snape-Like posters and stick them to the inside of the cabinets or shelves.
    <br>
    5. Professor Slughorn stuff will do too.
    <br>
    6. rearrange the 'potions bottles' so that it looks like snape's displays in the movies.
    <br>
    7. again, slughorn's way of "organizing" will do too. 6th movies
    <br>
    8. put labels on the actual shelves or canbinets. e.g. if one cabinet contains, say, pots, write 'caldrons' on the
    label. spices will be 'ingredients'
    <br>
    9. Stain the recipe books with tea to give them the parchment look. you can skip this step.
    <br>
    10. Make the recipe books look old.
    <br>
    11. chemicals could be labeled as 'poisons' 
    <br>
    12.Make the kitchen look dark, gloomy, and maybe dusty, which are the adjectives used in the books. (Yes I can memorize the books.)
    <br>
    13. Make sure that it looks like snape could look over your shoulder any minute.
    <br>
    <br>
    oh...13 steps...how spooooookyyyyy
